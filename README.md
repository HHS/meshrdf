# MeSH® RDF

***Status:  pre-beta.  Feedback is welcome, but please bear in mind that the data model is
subject to change.***

This repository contains a set of XSLT files that transform MeSH XML into RDF, and also contains
the content for the technical documentation pages, deployed as a set of GitHub pages, at
[http://hhs.github.io/meshrdf](http://hhs.github.io/meshrdf).

Please see that technical documentation for details about the data model, and how this new
RDF version of MeSH relates to the XML from which it derives.

The rest of this README describes how to set up a development environment, perform the
transformations yourself, if you are interested in doing that.  

All the instructions assume
that you're running on a Unix-like operating system, in a bash shell. If you have a Windows
machine, we recommend that you install [cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/). Please let us know
(by opening a GitHub issue here) if you have problems.


## Quick start

First, clone this repository:

    git clone https://github.com/HHS/meshrdf.git
    cd meshrdf

Next, you can either explore this repository using the included sample XML files (in the
*samples* directory, which are
relatively small), or, if you need complete and up-to-date data, you can download the latest
MeSH XML files from the NLM server.  The latter option is described first.


### Getting the MeSH XML files

Since the complete MeSH data files are quite large, we assume that they'll be kept
location on the filesystem that is separate from this GitHub repository.  Set the environment variable
$MESHRDF_HOME to point to that location.  For example,

    export MESHRDF_HOME=/var/data/mesh-rdf

You can run the script *bin/fetch-mesh-xml.sh*, which downloads all the XML and corresponding
DTD files from the NLM FTP server.  It saves them to the *data* subdirectory of $MESHRDF_HOME.

By default, it downloads the following:

* desc2014.dtd
* desc2014.xml
* pa2014.dtd
* pa2014.xml
* qual2014.dtd
* qual2014.xml
* supp2014.dtd
* supp2014.xml

If you want to download a different year's data, set the MESHRDF_YEAR environment variable
before executing the script. For example,

    MESHRDF_YEAR=2015 bin/fetch-mesh-xml.sh

***Note that at the time of this writing, the 2015 MeSH XML files have not yet been deployed
to that location.*** To specify the actual location for these files, use this command line:

    MESHRDF_YEAR=2015 MESHRDF_URI=ftp://ftp.nlm.nih.gov/online/mesh/.xmlmesh bin/fetch-mesh-xml.sh


### Getting Saxon

There are a number of different ways to run the XSLT stylesheets to convert the XML data
into RDF.  The XSLTs are written in XSLT 2.0, though, so the `xsltproc` command, which
comes on most Unix systems, will not work.

One easy way is to download and extract the open-source *Saxon Home Edition*, which
is written in Java, and will work on most platforms. You can download
it from [here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/saxon/files/Saxon-HE/).  Navigate to the latest version,
and follow the instructions (which appear after the list of files). As a shortcut, you can
download version 9.5 (which is known to work with these XSLTs) from the command line directly:

    wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/saxon/files/Saxon-HE/9.5/SaxonHE9-5-1-5J.zip

Unzip that into the *saxon9he* subdirectory.  For example:

    unzip -d saxon9he SaxonHE9-5-1-5J.zip

Set an environment variable SAXON_JAR to point to the executable Jar file:

    export SAXON_JAR=*repository-dir*/saxon9he/saxon9he.jar

Where *repository-dir* is the base directory of this repository.
If your version of Saxon is in a different location, then, of course, set this environment variable
appropriately.


### Converting the complete MeSH data set

The conversion script is *mesh-xml2rdf.sh*. This shell script will run the XSLTs to convert each of 
the three main MeSH XML files into RDF N-Triples format, and put the results into the 
*$MESHRDF_HOME/out* directory. 

By default, it looks for 2014 data files, and will produce *mesh.nt*, which is the 
RDF in N-triples format, and *mesh.nt.gz*, a gzipped version. Also by default, these 
data files will have RDF URIs that do not include the year. For example, the descriptor for 
Ofloxacin would have the URI http://id.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/D015242.

As with the fetch script, described above, you can use the MESHRDF_YEAR environment variable
to specify that it convert a different set of data files. For example:

    MESHRDF_YEAR=2015 bin/mesh-xml2rdf.sh

This uses the 2015 data files to produce the "current" RDF output files *out/mesh.nt*
and *out/mesh.nt.gz*.

To produce RDF data that has URIs with the year, then you should also set the
MESHRDF_URI_YEAR variable to "yes".  Thus, the following uses the 2015 MeSH XML files to
generate the data that has RDF URIs that include the year:

    MESHRDF_YEAR=2015 MESHRDF_URI_YEAR=yes bin/mesh-xml2rdf.sh

In this case, the output data files will be written to *out/mesh-2015.nt* and
*out/mesh-2015.nt.gz*.


### Generating and converting the sample files

In the *samples* subdirectory are a number of sample files that can be used for testing.
The XML files here are generated from the full MeSH XML files, but are included in the
repository so that anyone can get up and running, and try things out, very easily.

The *sample-list.txt* file has the list of items from each of the three main XML
files that provide a fairly good coverage of the variation of data found within MeSH.

These three sample files, corresponding to that list and the three main XML files,
are included in the repository:

* desc-samples.xml
* qual-samples.xml
* supp-samples.xml

The Perl script *make-samples.pl* can be used to regenerate these sample files from the
master XML files, extracting just those items that are listed in the *sample-list.txt*
file, if any of those changes.  So, keep in mind that these samples in the repository are
used for testing/demo purposes, and are not necessarily up-to-date with the latest MeSH
release.

Finally, the script *convert-samples.sh* can be used to convert the sample XML files into 
RDF, the final output being *samples.nt*.

***Note that the generated RDF will be missing a lot of meshv:parentTreeNumber 
relationships, because those are generated from the tree node identifiers to link between 
various records. Since the sample files contain only a subset of the records, most of 
these cannot be generated.***


## Project directory structure

These are the subdirectories of this project -- either part of the repository, or created:

* *bin* - Scripts for fetching the XML and running the conversions
* *meta* - Schema for the RDF, and other documentation
* *rnc* - Relax NG Compact version of the MeSH XML file schema (experimental, not normative)
* *samples* - XML data files for testing and demo purposes, which each contain a small subset
  of the items from the real XML data files, as described above.
* *xslt* - The main XSLT processor files that convert the XML into RDF.

These are the subdirectories of the $MESHRDF_HOME directory, which typically (but not necessarily)
is set to some separate location:

* *data* - Source MeSH XML and DTD files. These files are quite large, and change often,
  so they are not part of the repository, but should be downloaded separately, as described above.
* *out* - Product RDF files, in n-triples format.  The conversion scripts write these product
  files here.


## Virtuoso setup

Here are some notes for downloading and building OpenLink's Virtuoso software, which can be
used for querying the resulting RDF.  These notes are here for reference only, in case they
are helpful.  If these don't work for you, please direct questions to the OpenLink group.

Dependencies: gcc, gmake, autoconf, automake, libtool, flex, bison, gperf, gawk, m4, make, openssl-devel, readline-devel, wget.

Decide on a directory where you will install virtuoso, and set the $VIRTUOSO_HOME environment variable to point to that.

Checkout source from github:

    git clone https://github.com/openlink/virtuoso-opensource.git
    cd virtuoso-opensource
    git checkout develop/7   # should say already on develop/7

Build:

    ./autogen.sh
    CFLAGS="-O2 -m64"
    export CFLAGS
    ./configure --prefix=$VIRTUOSO_HOME
    make
    make install

Start up of server:

    cd $VIRTUOSO_HOME/virtuoso/var/lib/virtuoso/db
    $VIRTUOSO_HOME/bin/virtuoso-t

Shutdown of server (see [the Virtuoso
documentation](http://data-gov.tw.rpi.edu/wiki/How_to_install_virtuoso_sparql_endpoint#Manual_Shutdown)):

    $VIRTUOSO_HOME/bin/isql 1111 dba <password>
    SQL> shutdown();


## Technical documentation on GitHub pages

The gh-pages branch of this repository is used to generate the technical documentation
viewable from [http://hhs.github.io/meshrdf](http://hhs.github.io/meshrdf).  Please see the
[README file in that branch](../gh-pages/README.md) for more information.
